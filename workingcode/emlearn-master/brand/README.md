# emlearn brand guidelines

This document describes the brand of emlearn
and how it should be used.


## Written references

Written references should always be in **all-lower-case**.

```
emlearn
```

The first letter should **not** be capitalized.


## Pronounciation

emlearn is pronounced `E-M-learn`.

This is because it is a contraction of **E**mbedded **M**achine **learn**ing.


## Color palette
A monocromatic palette, with base in a bright and light blue.

```
Base:  #00bce8
Muted: #539ab3
Grey:  #97afb9
Light: #e4fdff
Dark:  #344a53
```

Pure white and pure black may also be used.


## Logo

There are three versions of the logo.

- Wide with wordmark
- Square with wordmark
- Square without wordmark

The wordmark versions should be used when possible.

When the name `emlearn` appears next to the logo for another reason,
the version without a wordmark can be used.

Logo should preferably be used in color, on a white background.
Where colors are not suitable, it should be used with black logo on white background.
The inverted version, with white logo on black background is generally to be avoided.
